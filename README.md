# Database normalization exercise,
## Description
Purpose of this project is to get practise on database normalization. Database is a simple .csv file that is in form 0NF. 
It contains some tables and other data. 

I approached this by first formatting the file to better suit csv fileformat so it would be easier to import into SQL database.
I coded a short python script with Pandas library to get rid of un-useful characters and align data properly. 

### Dependencies

```
pip install pandas 

import io
import re
```
